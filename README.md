## Introduction
Our project focuses on designing a **syringe pump** for medical applications. The device is intended to deliver precise volumes of fluids at controlled rates, crucial in treatments such as IV therapy and medication infusion. Key features include:
- **Adjustable flow rates** for various medical needs.
- **User-friendly interface** for medical professionals.
- **Compact design** for portability.

## Flow Chart
The operational workflow of the syringe pump is depicted below:
